 Hospital Management Dashboard

This project is a Power BI–based Hospital Management Dashboard designed to analyze hospital operations such as patient admissions, department performance, resource utilization, and peak admission hours.  
The goal is to support data-driven healthcare decisions through interactive visual analytics.


 Project Overview

The dashboard provides insights into:

- Total hospital admissions  
- Average Length of Stay (ALOS)  
- Department-wise performance  
- Resource distribution (Beds & Ventilators)  
- Staff utilization  
- Peak admission hours  

This project was created as part of a hackathon to demonstrate real-world healthcare analytics.

 Tech Stack

- Power BI Desktop  
- Python (for data seeding)  
- SQL (database schema)  
- GitHub (version control)  
- Google Drive (dashboard demo video)

 Dashboard Pages Explanation

Page 1 – Hospital Overview

This page provides a high-level summary of hospital operations:

- KPIs showing Total Admissions, Average Length of Stay (ALOS), and Total Cost  
- Admissions by Department (Cardiology, Oncology, Pediatrics, etc.)  
- Resource Distribution by Type (Beds vs Ventilators)  
- Doctor Count and Average Utilization by Department  

Purpose:  
To give management a quick snapshot of hospital performance and identify departments with high workload or resource demand.


Page 2 – Operational Insights

This page focuses on time-based analysis:

- Total Admissions KPI  
- Admissions by Admit Hour (Peak Hours Analysis)  
- Trend of Total Admissions  

Purpose:  
To identify peak admission periods and support staffing and resource planning during high-demand hours.
